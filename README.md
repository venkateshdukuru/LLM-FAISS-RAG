# LLM-FAISS-RAG
Create a PDF query system using OpenAI's LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and FAISS for efficient document retrieval. Extract and preprocess text from PDFs, index it using FAISS, and query relevant chunks. Integrate this with a user-friendly chat interface using Gradio, allowing users to input queries and receive responses based on the PDF content. The system enhances information retrieval from large document collections effectively.
